    <h1>The CO₂ GeoStorage Assessment App</h1>
    <div class="mar">
    <p>
      The main objective of this App is to analyse a geologic reservoir for CO₂
      storage based on some criteria. In contrast to surface mineral carbonation
      and ocean storage, the geological storage of CO₂ currently represents the
      best and likely the only short-to-medium term option for significantly
      reducing net carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The industrial revolution increased the need to search for new sources of
      energy. Society could no longer depend only on the primary forms of energy
      (human muscle, animal muscle, and biomass burning such as wood). So, the
      industrial revolution brought to our society new sources of energy such as
      fossil fuel (coal, oil, gas), and since then, it has become the most
      significant energy source, and even with more technology and other
      alternative forms of energy, fossil fuels still provide 84.3% of the
      world’s energy.The CO₂ occur from a couple of sources, mainly industrial,
      fossil fuel combustion in the power generation and transport sectors. The
      industrial sectors and the power generation have large volumes over 60%,
      making them more amenable to CO₂ capture technology than small point
      sources as transport and residential sectors contribute around 30% of the
      global CO₂ emission.
    </p>
    <p>
      As energy consumption continues to grow, CO₂ increases in the atmosphere,
      creating irreversible climate change. The measures to reduce CO₂ emissions
      are urgent to minimize long term climate change. Carbon dioxide capture
      and storage (CCS) is fully implemented, there is a potential of capturing
      and storing 236 billion tons of CO₂ globally by 2050 (Stangeland, 2007).
    </p>
    <p>
      The storage of CO₂ requires compression of CO₂ to allow injection by
      exposing the CO₂ to temperatures higher than 31.1º C and pressure greater
      than 73.9 bars. Here the density of CO₂ will increase with depth until
      about 800 metres or greater, where the injected CO₂ will be in a dense
      supercritical state. (NEWELL & ILGEN, 2019). Supercritical CO₂ is
      significantly less viscous than water or oil under the same subsurface
      conditions (IPCC, 2005 bert) whereby it has a density similar to a liquid
      but exhibits gas-type viscosity behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carbon dioxide can be stored geologically in a variety of different
      options as show on Figure be lower. Typical geological storage sites
      include deep saline formations, depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, EOR,
      unmineable coal seams, salt caverns, and basalt formations (Bachu, 2000).

    <p>
      Carbon dioxide becomes less mobile over time as a result of multiple
       trapping mechanisms, further lowering the prospect of leakage, which
       builds the confidence in geological security of carbon dioxide storage.
    </p>
    <p>
    The injected CO₂ can be immobilized typically under four different trapping
    exact mechanisms depending on the specific geological conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Structural or Stratigraphic - Trapping below an impermeable, confining layer or caprock;
      </li>
      <li>
        Residual CO₂ trapping - The CO₂ is retained or adhered on the surfaces of the
         pore spaces of the storage formation so that it becomes contained as immobile phase;
      </li>
      <li>
        Solubility trapping - The CO₂ is dissolved in the fluids contained in the pore spaces
         of the formation;
      </li>
      <li>
        Mineral trapping - It may be trapped by reacting with the minerals in the storage
        formation and caprock to produce carbonate minerals.
      </li>
    </ul>
        </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      The initial storage mechanism will dominant be physical trapping with increasing time
      and migration, more CO₂ is trapped residual in the pore space or is dissolved in the formation
      water, and finally mineral trapping may occur by precipitation of carbonate minerals after
      geochemical reaction, permanently trapping the CO₂ and increasing the storage security.(P6)

      Criteria for CO₂ Storage
    </h2>
    <br />
    <div class="mar">
    <p>
      The eliminatory criteria developed by Valer (2010) form the basis of site screening,
      a sedimentary basin or region that does not pass these criteria should not be considered for
       CO₂ storage.
    </p>

      alt="Eliminatory suitability criteria for assessing sedimentary basins for CO2 geological storage. (Valer, 2010)"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      On the tabel the first three criteria are critical because a basin or part thereof that does not satisfy
      all these should automatically be deemed unsuitable for CO₂ storage because of the high
       risk of compromising the safety and security of storage. The following four criteria are essential
       in the sense that there may be exceptional cases where one of these criteria is not being met, but
       all the others are, such a basin may still be considered for CO₂ storage. However, if more than
       one of the essential suitability criteria is not being met, then that basin or region should not be
       considered for CO₂ storage.  Finally, the last criterion is also critical, but, unlike the others, it is
       not a physical characteristic of the basin but rather a designation resulting from a legislative or
       regulatory action that may change in the future. (Valer, 2010).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other appropriateness criteria for CO₂ storage, listed on the next tabel, fall in the desirable category.
      None of these criteria is eliminatory by itself, and it could be that region thereof may have several
      unfavourable characteristics and still be considered for CO₂ storage. On the other hand, if too many
      criteria are unfavourable, serious consideration should be given to whether to proceed with CO₂
       geological storage in that basin or part thereof. (Valer, 2010)

    <p>
      However, if CO₂ geological sequestration or storage are to be implemented on a large scale, then there
       is need for a systematic, quantitative analysis of sedimentary basins in terms of their suitability.
    </p>
    <p>
      An overall ranking score would take these and other criteria into account to arrive at a quantitative
      evaluation regarding a basin’s suitability for CO₂ sequestration. The next table  presents a set of 15
      criteria for assessing and ranking sedimentary basins in terms of their suitability for CO₂ sequestration
      or storage. The list can be expanded further if more criteria are developed. Three to five classes have
      been defined in each category listed from the least favourable to the most favourable for CO₂
      sequestration or storage (Bachu, 2003).

      alt="Criteria for assessing sedimentary basins for CO2 geological sequestration. (Bachu, 2003)"
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      For each criterion i (i=1,..15) in Table 1 for evaluating basin suitability, a monotonically increasing
      numerical function Fi is assigned, which can be continuous or discrete, to describe a value placed on
      the specific class j for that criterion. The smallest and most outstanding values of this function
       characterize the worst and best class in terms of suitability for that criterion, i.e., Fi,1= min (Fi) and
       Fi, n = max (Fi), n represents the number of classes in that criterion (n=3, 4, or 5). If the classes have
       relatively equal importance assigned to them, then a linear function is probably best for Fi. The next
       table presents the numerical values assigned by Bachu (2003) here to the various classes for the
       criteria. The weights (wi) can be changed or adapted to changing conditions and priorities.

    />
    <br />
    <p>
      For any sedimentary basin k evaluated regarding its general suitability for CO₂ sequestration or
       storage, the corresponding class j for each criterion is identified, resulting in a corresponding
       score F(i,j). Because the function Fi has different ranges of values for each criterion, making
       comparisons and manipulations difficult, the individual scores F(i,j) are normalized according
       to: (Bachu, 2003)
    </p>

    />
    <br />
    <p>
      As a result of this process, each sedimentary basin k being evaluated is characterized by 15
      individual scores Pi^k, such that if Pi is closer to zero (Pi ≈ 0) is least favourable and if the
      Pi is closer to one (Pi ≈ 1) most favourable it is. The consequence of the parameterization and
       normalization is that it transforms various basin characteristics, which have differing meanings
        and importance, into dimensionless variables that vary between 0 and 1. These can subsequently
        be added to produce a general score R^(k), used in basin ranking, which is calculated using:
        (Bachu, 2003)

    <p>
      Using this methodology, sedimentary basins, or parts thereof, within a geographic region can be
      assessed and ranked in terms of their suitability for the geological storage of CO2. This ranking
      can be then used in making decisions for the large-scale implementation of such operations
      (Bachu, 2003).
