    <h1>The CO₂ GeoStorage Assessment App</h1>
    <div class="mar">
      <h2>Introdution</h2>
    <p>
      The main objective of this App is to analyses a geologic reservoir for CO₂ storage based on screening and ranking  criteria. In contrast to surface mineral carbonation and ocean storage, the geological storage of CO₂ currently represents the best and likely the only short-to-medium term option for significantly reducing net carbon emissions into the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The industrial revolution brought to our society new sources of energy such as fossil fuel (coal, oil, gas), and since then, it has become the most significant energy source, and even with more technology and other alternative forms of energy, fossil fuels still provide 84.3% of the world’s energy. The CO₂ occur from a couple of sources, mainly industrial, fossil fuel combustion in the power generation and transport sectors. The industrial sectors and the power generation have large volumes over 60%, making them more amenable to CO₂ capture technology than small point sources as transport and residential sectors contribute around 30% of the global CO₂ emission.
    </p>
    <p>
      As energy consumption continues to grow, CO₂ increases in the atmosphere,
      creating irreversible climate change. The measures to reduce CO₂ emissions
      are urgent to minimize long term climate change. If carbon dioxide capture
      and storage (CCS) is fully implemented, there is a potential of capturing
      and storing 236 billion tons of CO₂ globally by 2050 (Stangeland, 2007).
    </p>
    <p>
      The storage of CO₂ requires compression of CO₂ to allow injection by
      exposing the CO₂ to temperatures higher than 31.1º C and pressure greater
      than 73.9 bars. Here the density of CO₂ will increase with depth until
      about 800 metres or greater, where the injected CO₂ will be in a dense
      supercritical state. (NEWELL & ILGEN, 2019). Supercritical CO₂ is
      significantly less viscous than water or oil under the same subsurface
      conditions (Bert, 2005 ) whereby it has a density similar to a liquid
      but exhibits gas-type viscosity behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carbon dioxide can be stored geologically in a variety of different
      options. Typical geological storage sites
      include deep saline formations, depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, EOR,
      unmineable coal seams, salt caverns, and basalt formations (Bachu, 2000).
    </p>
    <p>
      Carbon dioxide becomes less mobile over time as a result of multiple
       trapping mechanisms, further lowering the prospect of leakage, which
       builds the confidence in geological security of carbon dioxide storage.
    </p>
    <p>
    The injected CO₂ can be immobilized typically under four different trapping
    exact mechanisms depending on the specific geological conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Structural or Stratigraphic - Trapping below an impermeable, confining layer or caprock;
      </li>
      <li>
        Residual CO₂ trapping - The CO₂ is retained or adhered on the surfaces of the
         pore spaces of the storage formation so that it becomes contained as immobile phase;
      </li>
      <li>
        Solubility trapping - The CO₂ is dissolved in the fluids contained in the pore spaces
         of the formation;
      </li>
      <li>
        Mineral trapping - It may be trapped by reacting with the minerals in the storage
        formation and caprock to produce carbonate minerals.
      </li>
    </ul>
        </p>
    <p>
      The initial storage mechanism will dominant be physical trapping with increasing time
      and migration, more CO₂ is trapped residual in the pore space or is dissolved in the formation
      water, and finally mineral trapping may occur by precipitation of carbonate minerals after
      geochemical reaction, permanently trapping the CO₂ and increasing the storage security.

    <h2>
    Screening and Ranking Criteria for CO₂ Storage
    </h2>
    <br />
    <div class="mar">
    <p>
      To start the assessment, it analyses the eliminatory criteria developed by Valer (2010) for the basis of site screening, a sedimentary basin or region that does not pass these criteria should not be considered for CO₂ storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eliminatory criteria are divided these in two parts. On the table the first three are the critical criteria which means that if it does not satisfy all these it should automatically be deemed unsuitable for CO₂ storage because of the high risk of compromising the safety and security of storage. The following four are essential criteria which, means that there may be exceptional cases where one of these criteria is not being met, but all the others are, such a basin may still be considered for CO₂ storage. However, if more than one of the essential suitability criteria is not being met, then that basin or region should not be considered for CO₂ storage.  Finally, the last criterion is also critical, but, unlike the others, it is not a physical characteristic of the basin but rather a designation resulting from a legislative or regulatory action that may change in the future. (Valer, 2010)

    <br />
    <p>
      On the tabel the first three criteria are critical because a basin or part thereof that does not satisfy
      all these should automatically be deemed unsuitable for CO₂ storage because of the high
       risk of compromising the safety and security of storage. The following four criteria are essential
       in the sense that there may be exceptional cases where one of these criteria is not being met, but
       all the others are, such a basin may still be considered for CO₂ storage. However, if more than
       one of the essential suitability criteria is not being met, then that basin or region should not be
       considered for CO₂ storage.  Finally, the last criterion is also critical, but, unlike the others, it is
       not a physical characteristic of the basin but rather a designation resulting from a legislative or
       regulatory action that may change in the future. (Valer, 2010).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if CO₂ geological sequestration or storage are to be implemented on a large scale, then there is need for a systematic, quantitative analysis of sedimentary basins in terms of their suitability.

    </p>
    <p>
      An overall ranking score would take these and other criteria into account to arrive at a quantitative evaluation regarding a basin’s suitability for CO₂ sequestration. The next steps will be a choose between  the Bachu criteria and the modified criteria from Bachu and Kalid and Gilbson-Pooler. Then the selection of 15 criteria for assessing and ranking sedimentary basins in terms of their suitability for CO₂ sequestration or storage. The list can be expanded further if more criteria are developed. Three to five classes have been defined in each category listed from the least favorable to the most favorable for CO₂ sequestration or storage (Bachu, 2003).
